## New Features:

Bing Translate API:

Bing Translate API allows the responses to be translated into any language of choice, Since this is a canadian astronaut, I chose to output the chatbot's response in both English and French.


Example of Improvement:
Previously, the bot would have just English output, But now the bot responds in both English and French as shown below! This API also works inconjuction with the other API also.

Wikipedia API:

Wikipedia API allows the chatbot to have access to information snippets from Wikipedia and show them, when conditions are met such as asking a specific  question about a famous person.


Example of Improvement:
Previously, the bot would have have limited information access but with this API integrated into the chatbot the bot now has access to more information and is able to tell you about lets see "who is emma watson? " as shown below!
