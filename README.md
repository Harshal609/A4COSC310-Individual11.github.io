## New Features:

Bing Translate API:

Sentiment Analysis allows the bot to determine if a user’s input has a friendly or condescending attitude. If the user’s input is overwhelmingly positive, the bot will respond with a specific message (“thank you!”, “I appreciate it!”, etc). Likewise, the bot will have a defensive message (‘stop being rude!”, etc).
Example of Improvement:
Previously, the bot would have the same responses for input that is extremely friendly or offensive like a robot that couldn’t recognize emotion in human speech. Now that the bot responds more naturally to sentimental input, it feels a lot more realistic and human (despite being a bot).
